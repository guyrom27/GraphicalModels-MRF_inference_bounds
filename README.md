# Bounding the Error of Markov Network Inference Algorithms 
## Guy Rom, Amir Globerson

We study the expected errors in the setting suggested by [Globerson et al. (2015)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/globerson15.pdf)
of exact and approximate inference algorithms on Markov Networks. We give a lower bound for the exact algorithm on a general graph, and show that it is tight in several cases, using the results of [Globerson et al. (2015)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/globerson15.pdf)
and [Foster et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02728), including chains, trees and 2D grids.
We present an upper bound on a poly time approximate inference for general graphs and discuss the meaning of the margin between the recovery performances.
